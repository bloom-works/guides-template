## At-will notice

Your employment is At-Will. You are not hired for any definite or specified period of time even though your wages are paid regularly. You are an at-will employee of Bloom and your employment can be terminated at any time, with or without cause and with or without prior notice. Company policy requires all employees to be hired at-will and this policy cannot be changed by any oral modifications. There have been no implied or verbal agreements or promises to you that you will be discharged only under certain circumstances or after certain procedures are followed. There is no implied employment contract created by this Guidebook or any other Company document or written or verbal statement or policy.

Only authorized management may alter or modify any of the policies in this Employee Guidebook with the exception of the "At-Will Employment" provision, which cannot be altered by anybody. Nothing in this guidebook is intended to infringe upon employee rights under Section Seven (7) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).

## Equal employment

Bloom provides equal employment opportunities and administers all aspects and conditions of employment without regard to age, race, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth or medical condition related to pregnancy or childbirth), gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, veteran status, military status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law. Bloom takes allegations of discrimination, intimidation, harassment and retaliation very seriously and will promptly conduct an investigation when warranted.

Equal employment opportunity includes, but is not limited to, employment, training, promotion, demotion, transfer, leaves of absence, and termination.

## Reasonable accommodations

It is the policy of Bloom to comply with all the relevant and applicable provisions of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as well as state and local laws concerning the employment of persons with disabilities. Bloom will not discriminate against any qualified employee or job applicant because of a person's physical or mental disability with respect to any terms, privileges, or conditions of employment, including but not limited to hiring, advancement, discharge, compensation, and training.

Employees who become disabled should notify administration if the conditions of the disability impair their ability to perform the essential functions of their position. Where necessary and feasible, reasonable accommodations will be made for qualified disabled employees to perform the essential functions of the job in question, as long as the accommodation does not cause Bloom undue hardship.

## Exempt v. non-exempt

**Exempt:** Employees whose positions meet specific tests established by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state law and who are exempt from overtime pay requirements. The basic premise of exempt status is that the exempt employee is to work the hours required to meet his/her work responsibilities. This includes managers and assistant managers as well as designated office personnel.

**Non-exempt:** Employees whose positions do not meet FLSA and state exemption tests and who are paid a multiple of their regular rate of pay for overtime hours worked.
